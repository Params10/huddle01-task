# Huddle01 Web SDK

## Getting Started

1. **Get the Huddle01 JS SDK**

```
$ npm install --save huddle01-client
```

2. **Get your API Key:** You can get your access keys in the Developer section of the Huddle01 Dashboard

3. **Import modules & instantiate Huddle01 Client:**

```javascript
import HuddleClient, { emitter } from "huddle01-client";
```

**The infrastructure mandates a schema on the URL** of the type `https://domain.com/room?roomId=C132`

Thus, on component mount, we add:

```javascript
history.push(`?roomId=${config.roomId}`);
```

Initialise a new object

```javascript
const huddle = new HuddleClient(config);
```

where `config`:

```javascript
//write this as it is -- used to check for the recorder
const isRecorderBot = localStorage.getItem("bot_password") === "huddle01";

const config = {
  apiKey: "<API Key>", //issued on the dashboard
  roomId: "C132",
  peerId: "rick254", //needs to be unique for every peer
  displayName: "Rick Sanchez",
  window, //your browser's window object
  isBot,
};
```

By this step, you should be connected to the Huddle servers.

**To allow recordings**, make sure to add:

```javascript
huddle && isRecorderBot && joinRoomBtn.click();
```

**where**:  
`huddle: the huddle-client object

isRecorderBot: the boolean that checks if the user is a recorder bot or not

joinRoomBtn: the button`

### Setting up event listeners

The emitter that we imported in the 1st step is used to emit events by Huddle about your application.

**The various types of events are:**

="roomState" %}
**Trigger:** on room status changes  
**Return value:** room status of the type `string`

```javascript
emitter.on("roomState", (state) => {
  //do whatever (ideally switch-case between all state types)
});
```

Please refer to the demo app for application references

#### Different state types:

| connected                          | failed                            | disconnected                            |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| successfully connected to the room | failure in connection to the room | successfully disconnected from the room |

="error" %}
**Trigger:** an error event on client/server side  
**Return value:** error message of the type `string`

```javascript
emitter.on("error", (error) => {
  //do whatever
});
```

Please refer to the demo app for application references

="addPeer" %}
**Trigger:** new peer joins the room  
**Return value:** an entire peer object with all the details about the peer of the type `object`

```javascript
emitter.on("addPeer", (peer) => {
  //do whatever
});
```

Please refer to the demo app for application references

="addProducer" %}
**Trigger:** you have a new producer producing to the Huddle servers  
**Return value:** an producer object with details like your production media track \(eg. webcam/mic/screenshare\) of the type `object`

```javascript
emitter.on("addProducer", (producer) => {
  //do whatever (ideally switch-case between all state types)
});

All the data/states received by events need to be maintained by you in your app. Can be achieved using React states/redux or any similar implementations.

Please refer to the demo app where we use local React states to handle these data.

### Methods Available:

- **huddle.join\(\)**
- **huddle.close\(\)**

`close()` can only be called after `join()` is successful

="joinRoom\(\)" %}

```javascript
const joinRoom = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    setupEventListeners();
    await huddle.join();
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error);
  }
};
```

="leaveRoom\(\)" %}

```javascript
const leaveRoom = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    await huddle.close();
    setRoomState(false);
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error);
  }
};
```

{% endtabs %}

- **huddle.enableWebcam\(\)**
- **huddle.enableMic\(\)**
- **huddle.enableShare\(\)**

```javascript
const enableWebcam = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    await huddle.enableWebcam();
    setWebcamState(true);
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error);
  }
};
```

- **huddle.disableWebcam\(\)**
- **huddle.disableShare\(\)**
- **huddle.disableMic\(\)**

```javascript
const disableWebcam = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    await huddle.disableWebcam();
    setWebcamState(false);
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error);
  }
};
```

`enable()` functions need to be called and have returned success first before calling any of the `disable()`counterparts

- **huddle.startRecording\(\)**
- **huddle.stopRecordig\(\)**

Recordings will only work in production environments \(or run a local process of the recorder on your machine if you want to test in development environments\)

="startRecording\(\)" %}

```javascript
const startRecording = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    const status = await huddle.startRecording();
    if (status !== true)
      console.error("an error occurred while initiating recording");
    console.log("recording initiated");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

="stopRecording\(\)" %}

```javascript
const stopRecorder = async () => {
  if (!huddle) return;
  try {
    const status = await huddle.stopRecording();
    if (status !== true)
      console.error("an error occurred while initiating recording");
    console.log("recording initiated");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```
